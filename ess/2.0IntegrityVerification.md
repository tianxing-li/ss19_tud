# Integrity Verification

**Embedded System Security**
Goal: To achieve the security goals in resource-constrained computing systems
Challenge: Known security solutions not applicable to these systems; Wide range of devices with different capabilities and requirements

## Microcontroller
A/D -> CPU -> D/A
Cpprocessor = CPU = Memory [ROM, RAM, FLASH]

## Integrity Verification
Ensures that the system is in the expected state
System state is defined by the contents of its memory
Encsure integrity by verifying memory contents(Make memory immutable[ROM], check memory contents)

### Check memory contents
small code in ROM checks the contents of flash memory
1. Code in ROM is started
2. this code caculates the checksum of contents of flash memory
3. the checksum is compared with a known reference value

### secure boot
ensures the system is started into expected state
each component verifies its successor: if the successor in the expected state, it's executed, else boot process is aborted

Firmware -> Loader -> OS -> App 1, 2, 3, ...
the first three is __system software__

the first element is the __Root of Trust(RTM)__
a. is executed on each sys. startup
cannot be verified
is trusted
trust in secure boot is based on the trust in RTM

### Authenticated Boot
Enables the verification of the initial system state
Each boot component measures its successor but does not verify it
Checksums of all boot components represent the system state right after the completion of the boot process
External verifier decides on the integrity of the system
Requirements (Integrity of measurements, Authenticity of measurements)

## Remote Attestation
1. Verifier(Remote) send a challenge c to prover(software)
2. Prover use attestor to measure software state [r=F(c, memory; param)]
3. Prover send response r back
4. verifier check response

**attestor:** adversary and trust model (typically a small trust anchor, software attacks only)

### remote attestation requirements
**Prover reports state to verifier**
state is the content of memory
represented via HASH of the memory content

**Requirements**
1. authentication of prover
Attestation must be done by trusted component of the Prover
Trusted component has exclusive access to key (creates HASH-MAC)
2. freshness of attestation
Verifier challenges Prover on ever attestation to ensure freshness
3. integrity of attestation
The complete state (of the component to attest) must be attested
State must not change while attested
