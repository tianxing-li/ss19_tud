# Introduction to SS

## 1. Motivation and basic Notions
### Notion of security
security: peotection of assets
Risk analysis is part of information security strategy

**rough classification** of protective measures distingguishes between
__prevention__
__detection__
__reaction__

computer security: protection of information assets
Def. of computer security: Computer security deals with the prevention and detection of unauthorized actions by users of a computer system.

**Data vs. Information**
computer security is about controlling access to information and resources
controlling access to information <=> data
data: physical phenomena chosen by convention to represent certain aspects of our conceptual and real world
info.: the meaning we assign to data

**Reliability:** Related to (accidental) failures in the system
**Safety:** Related to the impact of system failures on their environment, which
also deal with situations where the system has to perform properly in adverse
conditions
**Security:** Deals with prevention and detection of unauthorized actions in the
system
security is an aspect of reliability or vice versa

**Dependability:** a value showing the reliability

**Vulnerabilities:**
Hardware: interruption (DoS), Interception (theft)
Software: Interruption (Deletion), interception, modification
Data: Interruption (loss), interception, modification, fabrication

### security and privacy targets

**Confidentiality (Vertraulichkeit):** Prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information
**Integrity (Integrität):** Prevention of unauthorized modification of information
**Availability (Verfügbarkeit):** Prevention of unauthorized withholding of
information or resources

**Authenticity (Authentizität):** Integrity of a message content and origin, and possibly of some other information, such as the time of emission
**Accountability (Zurechenbarkeit):** Availability and integrity of the identity of the subject who performed an operation; Data origin authentication (verifying the source of transmitted data), Entity authentication (verifying the identity of an entity)
**Non-repudiation (Verbindlichkeit):** Availability and integrity of the identity of the sender of a message (nonrepudiation of the origin) or, of the receiver (non-repudiation of reception) Ability to prove this to (honest) third parties

**Privacy**
**Anonymity (Anonymität)**
**Untraceability (Nicht-Rückverfolgbarkeit)**
**Unlinkability (Unverknüpfbarkeit)**
**Unobservalibity (Unbeobachtbarkeit)**

#### dimensions of computer security
software <-- protection mechanism --> hardware
user(subject) <-- security policy --> ressource(object)

**subjet**: active entity
**object**: a passive entity (file or a record in a database)

**vertical axis**
users(outside system)==system interface=>application(outside security perimeter[not security-relevant{untrusted}])==security perimeter interface=>operating system==hardware=>hardware
Inside security perimeter: security-relevant(trusted) [os, hardware]

### Physical security
describe protection of material assets from fire, water damage, theft, or similar perils
involves technologies used to safeguard information against
physical attack

Now the assets are often information, which can be stolen without being physically removed from where they are

**Effective Physical Security**
In the event of an attack, there should be a low probability of success, and
A high probability of detection either during the attack, or subsequent to penetration

### security testing methods 

**Tapmer-Resistant Sys**: manipulationssciherheit
Thick steel or other robust materials are utilized to slow down the attack
by requiring powerful tools and great effort to breach the system
Example:
 Design of an automated teller machine (ATM)
 Tamper resistant physical security is usually the easiest to apply
Weight and bulk of the system can be a problem or benefit,
depending on the application

Complexity or size can be another variety of temper resistance:
 Single chip implementations of secure devices have a certain level of
physical security due to the small size of the features and the complexity of
determining which part of the circuit performs which function

**Tapmer-Responding Sys**: use the burglar alarm approach: The __defense is the detection of the intrusion__, followed by a response to protect the asset
Tamper-responding systems do not depend on robust construction or weight to guard an asset
Erasure or destruction of secret data is sometimes employed to prevent theft in the case of isolated systems which cannot depend on outside response

**Tamper-Evident Sys.:** ensure that __if a break occurs, evidence of the breakin
is left behind__

authenticity mean: intergrity of a message content and origin
confidentiality mean: prevention of unauthorized disclosure of info
