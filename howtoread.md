# 1. the first pass
the first pass is a quick scan to get a bird's eye view of the paper.
can decide whether need to do any more passes.
take 5 to 10 minutes, consists of:
## a. carefully read the title, abstract, and intro
## b. read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
## c. read the conclusions
## d. glance over the references, mentally ricking off the ones you've already read

at the end of the first pass, should be able to answer:
## a. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
## b. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
## c. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
## d. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
## e. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

## how to write!!!
Incidentally, when write a paper, can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. 
Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. 
If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; 
if a reader cannot understand the highlights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

# 2. the second pass
read the paper with **greater care**, but **ignore details** such as proofs.

## a. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
## b. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

The second pass should take up to an hour. After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in your research speciality.

# 3. the third pass
attempt to **virtually re-implement** the paper: making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

requires great attention to detail.
	identify and challenge every assumption in every statement
	Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. 
	This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.


# A. DOING A LITERATURE SURVEY
well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area.
Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.

find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, or a pointer to a recent survey paper.
if not, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography.
go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently.

go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. 
A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work.
These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.

# B. EXPERIENCE
prevents from drowning in the details before getting a bird’s-eye-view
