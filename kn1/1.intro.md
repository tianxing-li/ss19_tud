# 1. Telegraphy

Morse Telegraph: variable length(short code for frequently used letters)
+: fast
-: gap thing

SOS: ... --- ...

Baudot code: fix size (5 bits)


# 2. Telephony
tin can telephone = lover's telephone 土电话

1869, Johann Philipp Reis, successful electronic sound transmission
1876/77, Thomas Edison, first patents for telephone technology granted in US
1870s first telephones sold pairwise n(n-1)/2
-> 1877: first manually switched phone exchange, telephone switches (central switch)
-> 1892, Strowger switches automated phone exchange
4G is 4.th Generation Wireless Mobile Networks, first release UMTS Standart.

# 3. Telegraphy vs. Telephony

Telegraph networks: message switching, connectionless service
Telephony networks: circuit switching, connection oriented service

# 4. Television

1831- 1890 basics of radio transmission
1895 wireless telegraphy demonstrated

**broadcast**

# 5. Television vs. Telephony and Telegraphy

Television: broadcast medium, one sender, many receivers, inherent property of radio transmission
Telephony (and telegraphy): unicast medium, one sender one receiver, inherent property of circuit switshed network.

# 6. Internet

1961 packet switching theory
1967 ARPANET concept published
1971 23 hosts connected
1973 initial TCP/IP idea

request for comments(rfc)

1982 smtp e-mail protocol
1983 DNS
1985 ftp
1988 tcp congestion control
1990 web

later 1990s p2p, network security to forefront

2010s skype(VoIP)

future: high bandwidth, high coverage, low  cost, low latency, real-time, high reliability

ES: End System
IS: Intermediate System

LAN: 10m-1km
MAN: 10km
WAN: 100km-

mobile-wired: mobile IP
mobile-wireless: mobile telephony
fixed-wired: POTS, Existing LANs
Fixed-wireless: wireless LAN, cordless telephone

wired-wireless (wired or radio connection)
mobile-fixed (connection to network rither static or dynamic)

protocol <-> protocol: format, order of message
service (layer n+1): characterized by the "interface"
|
service (layer n)

connection-oritented: telephone service(1. connect; 2. transfer data; 3. disconnect)
no reliability, flow control or congestion control is requiered
TCP implements them
connections are nothing but a distributed "state", held at both end point.

connectionless: postal service
transfer of isolated unit data, go straight to data transfer phase, no connection teardown phase
no need to maintain connection state
receiver may not be ready
do not implement: reliability, flow control, congestion control. eg. UDP

connectionless protocols are much easier to conceive and implement as connection-oriented protocol.

ISO OpenSystemsInterconnection Reference Model
app, pre, session, trans, net, data link, phy

# 7. Layers
## a. Physical Layer: PH
Signal representation of bits: sending bit 1 is also received as bit 1 (and not as bit 0)
## b. data link: D
Reliable data transfer between adjacent stations with frames
flow control
medium access control (MAC)
logical link control [error detection] -> MAC (CSMA/CD, tokens)
## c. Network: N
connection (as relationship between entities)
end system to end system
subnets with packets
routing (addressing, ip[connectionless], x.25[connectoritient])
## d. transport: T
Connection (as relationship between entities)
From source (application/process) to destination (application/process)
## e. session: S
support a "session" over a longer period
synchronization, token management
## f. presentation: P
negotiating the data struceture
conversion into a global data structure [ascii, unicode]
## g. application related services: A
email, directory service (ftp, www, p2p)
