# 02. Physical Layer

## 1. Basics
ISO DEFINITION: the physical layer provides the following features…
 Mechanical: size of plugs
 Electrical: voltage
 Functional: switching functions
 Procedural: synchronized data transfer

A physical connection permits transfer of a bitstream in the modes
 Duplex or
 Semi-duplex

### 1.2 Bit Rate and Baud Rate
BAUD RATE = Number of SYMBOLS (characters) transmitted PER unit of time
BIT RATE = Number of BITS transferred per Second (bps)

### 1.3 Operating Modes
**transfer directions**
simplex: one direction only
Semi-duplex (half-duplex): Data is transferred into both directions. But never simultaneously.
Full-duplex: Data may flow simultaneously in both directions
**serial and parallel transmission**
Parallel: Signals are transmitted simultaneously over several channels
Serial: Signals are transmitted sequentially over one channel

**Synchronous Transmission**
Def.: pre-defined by a regular clock pulse (requires synchronization)
Implementation: receiving clock pulse(on a separate line or gained from the signal), bit synchronous or frame synchronous
SOH Start of Header
STX Start of Text
ETX End of Text

**Asynchronous Transmission**
Def.: Clock __pulse fixed__ for the duration of a signal
Implementation: sender and receiver generate the clock pulse independently from each other 
Frame size usually approx. 9 bit
7 Bit ASCII reference data
1 Parity Bit (odd, even, or unused)
1 Start-Bit
1 Stop-Bit

## 2. Analog and Digital Information Encoding and Transmission

|            |                       |  Transmission       |                    |
|            |                       |  Analog             |  Digital           |
| ---------- |:---------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------:|
| info. code | Analog(voice, music)  |  POTS -> AM, FM     | ISDN -> PCM, DM    |
|            | Digital(txt, img)     |  Modem(analog tel.) | ISDN(data service) |
|            |                       |  PAM, PPM, PFM      | Manchester Encoding|

POTS: plain old telephone service

**Binary Encoding**
1: voltage on high
0: voltage on low

+: simple, cheap, goo utilization of bandwidth (1 bit per  Baud)
-: No "self-clocking" feature

**Manchester Encoding**
1: high to low
0: low to high

+: good "self-clocking"
-: 0.5 bit/baud

application: 802.3(csma/cd)

**Differential Manchester Encoding**
1: no change in the  level at the beginning of the interval
0: change in the level

110011: lh hl hl hl lh hl
if 1 then change, if 0, like before

+: good "self-clocking", low susceptibility to noise
-: 0.5 bit/baud, complex

## 3. Muliplexing Techniques
**FDM**
share bandwidth
Frequency band is split between the users
Each user is allocated one frequency band
**TDM**
share time
User receives a time slot
During this time slot the user has the full bandwidth
