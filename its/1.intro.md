Security is the protection of assets and resources against intentional attacks.

security mgmt = risk mgmt
risk = probability of occurence * business impact / controls

		Security-------------------denpendability-------------safety

Laws and contracts typically require compliance rather than security

Attacks can be well-organized and involve multiple steps and targets

Attackers can be amateurs, crackers, career criminals, terrorists or even nations

System complexity is one of the reasons for vulnerabilities and insecurity
