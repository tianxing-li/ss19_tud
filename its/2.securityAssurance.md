# 2.1. motivation & intro
## Security assurance provides justification that a target meets security requirements
security requirements	--->	assurance	<---	target

security requirements: desired security properties of a type of product

assurance: certification that target meets requirements

target: product of part of a product

## vendor's secure engineering process

**vendor**
_training_ -> 1. requirements -> 2. design -> 3. implementation -> 4. verification -> 5. release [mandatory docs, tools, tests, reviews, verification, ...]

**buyer**
_response_

### 3rd party assurance
independent evaluation & certification

covering most phases

ideal: augmenting internal assurance

just before/after release

third party assurance ![third party assurance](./img/3rdpartyassurance.png)

__Main drivers for assurance are government policies__
**1. Driver: Government policies**
**2. Driver: Commercial expectations**

# 2.2. trusted computer ststem evaluation criteria
rainbow series(us)

TUSEC 1st. security assurance standard

security functional requirements (SFR): specific for OS, architecture, functions, policy models

security assurance requirements (SAR): documentation, design and test methodology, actual tests

**A** - Verified Protection

A1: verified design

**B** - Mandatory Protection

B3: security domains

B2: structured protection

B1: labeled security protection

**C** - Diecretionary protection

C2: controlled access protection

C1: discretionary security protection

**D** - Minimal protection

D1: minimal protection

Market accepted functional difference between B1 and C2
below C1(weak) and above B2(expensive)
focus too narrow: os(no network, no app.)

# 2.3. Common Criteria (Version 3.1 revision 5)
Basic Terminology ![basic terminology](./img/CC_basicterminology.png)

EAL 1: Functionally tested

EAL 2: Structurally tested

EAL 3: Methodically tested and checked

EAL 4: Methodically designed, tested and reviewed

EAL 5: Semi-formally designed and tested

EAL 6: Semi-formally verified design and tested

EAL 7: Formally verified design and tested

**Target of evaluation (TOE) is a set of softfirm- or hardware possibly with guidance.**

**Protection Profiles (PP) capture the security needs of a class of products whereas Security Targets (ST) capture security needs of a specific product.**

### Security Targets and Protection Profiles ![ST & PP](./img/ST&PP.png)

### Security requirements consist of functional and assurance requirements
**Security Functional Requirements (SFR)**: translation of the security objectives for the TOE into a standardized language

Use of standardized language to:

1. provide an exact description of what is to be evaluated

2. allow comparison between two security targets

**Security Assurance Requirements (SAR)**: description of how assurance is to be gained that the TOE meets the SFRs

Use of standardized language to:

1. provide an exact description of how the TOE is to be evaluated

2. allow comparison between two security targets

### CC Functional Classes
Audit (FAU), 
Communications (FCO), 
Cryptography Support (FCS), 
User Data Protection (FDP), 
Identification and Authentication (FIA),

# 2.4. CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULES (FIPS 140-2)
### FIPS PUB 140-2 is a US government evaluation standard for crypto modules
Most important evaluation standard for crypto modules

4 Levels: Security Level 1-4
### FIPS ![fips](./img/fips.png)

**NIST has a list of certified crypto. processors, e.g. IBM 4765 PCIe**
Hardware IBM 4765 2011.02.24, oberall level: 4

1. fips-approved algorithms: AES, RNG, RSA, SHS

2. other algorithms: DES MAC
